It is closely related to the **Quicksort sorting algorithm.** Like **Quicksort**, it is efficient traditionally and offers good average-case performance, but has a *poor worst-case performance.*\n","\n"," \n","For example,\n","```\n","Input: [7, 4, 6, 3, 9, 1]\n","k = 2\n","Output: k’th smallest array element is 3\n","\n","Input: [7, 4, 6, 3, 9, 1]\n","k = 1\n","Output: k’th smallest array element is 1\n","```"],"metadata":{"id":"eFnn01cLDyVv"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Quickselect** uses the same overall approach as **Quicksort**, choosing one element as a **pivot** and *partitioning the data in two based on the pivot*, accordingly as *less than or greater than the pivot*. However, instead of recursing into both sides as in **Quicksort**, **quickselect** only recurs into one side with its searching element. \n","\n","Since the **pivot** is in its final sorted position, all those preceding it in unsorted order, and all those following it in an unsorted order. This reduces the **average-case** complexity from **O(n.log(n)) to O(n)** with a **worst-case** of **O(n^2)**, \n","<br>where **n** is the size of the input."],"metadata":{"id":"Nixt6bsFEla5"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Time complexity:\n","\n","Like Quicksort, the quickselect has good average performance but is sensitive to the chosen pivot. With good pivots, meaning ones that consistently decrease the search set by a given fraction, the search set decreases exponentially. By induction (or summing the geometric series), one sees that performance is linear, as each step is linear. The overall time is constant (depending on how quickly the search set reduces). However, if bad pivots are consistently chosen, such as decreasing by only a single element each time, then worst-case performance is quadratic: **O(n^2)**. For example, this occurs in searching for the maximum element of a set, using the first element as the pivot, and having sorted data."],"metadata":{"id":"S1FZn-xHFejg"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":23,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"4Ap3S9q5DPNz","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1647869239361,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":379,"user":{"displayName":"AMITKUMAR DUBEY","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"13607019546596109318"}},"outputId":"c323c860-5283-4ee7-f8e0-9f174483e604"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["k'th smallest element is 3\n"]}],"source":["from random import randint\n"," \n","def swap(nums, i, j):\n","    temp = nums[i]\n","    nums[i] = nums[j]\n","    nums[j] = temp\n"," \n"," \n","# Partition using Lomuto partition scheme\n","def partition(nums, left, right, pIndex):\n"," \n","    # Pick `pIndex` as a pivot from the list\n","    pivot = nums[pIndex]\n","    # print(\"left\".ljust(25,' '),left)\n","    # print(\"right\".ljust(25,' '),right)\n","    # print(\"pIndex\".ljust(25,' '),pIndex)\n","    # print(\"nums\".ljust(25,' '),nums)\n","    # print(\"pivot\".ljust(25,' '),pivot)\n","       \n","    # print()\n"," \n","    # Move pivot to end\n","    swap(nums, pIndex, right)\n","    # print(\"After swap: pIndex, right\\n\")\n","    # print(\"nums\".ljust(25,' '),nums)\n","    # print(\"right\".ljust(25,' '),right)\n","    # print(\"pIndex\".ljust(25,' '),pIndex)\n"," \n","    # elements less than the pivot will be pushed to the left of `pIndex`;\n","    # elements more than the pivot will be pushed to the right of `pIndex`;\n","    # equal elements can go either way\n","    pIndex = left\n","    # print(\"pIndex = left\".ljust(25,' '),pIndex)\n"," \n","    # each time we find an element less than or equal to the pivot, `pIndex`\n","    # is incremented, and that element would be placed before the pivot.\n","    for i in range(left, right):\n","        if nums[i] <= pivot:\n","            swap(nums, i, pIndex)\n","            pIndex = pIndex + 1\n","            # print(\"element < pivot\".ljust(25,' '),nums)\n","    # Move pivot to its place\n","    swap(nums, pIndex, right)\n","    # print(\"final nums\".ljust(25,' '),nums)\n"," \n","    # return `pIndex` (index of the pivot element)\n","    return pIndex\n"," \n"," \n","# Returns the k'th smallest element in a list within `left…right` (i.e., left <= k <= right). \n","# The search space within the list is changing for each round – but the list is \n","# still the same size.
